#### Goal of this homework

Develop a shinny app for gapminder data.


#### Reflection:

The most difficult part is to make `ui.R` and `server.R` talk. The debugging is difficult for longer R codes in the `server.R`.
Next time I would prefer to write some helper functions rather than put the code in `server.R`.
There are many widges and neat funtions of Shinny I haven't had the chance to explore yet. I will try to improve the app later.
